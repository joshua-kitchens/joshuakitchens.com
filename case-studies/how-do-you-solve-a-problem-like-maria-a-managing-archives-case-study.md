<p>Scenario</p>
<p>You’re the director of an archive with a staff of three, plus a rotating cadre of student workers. Maria is not an archivist, nor does she have a graduate degree of any kind. Maria has been the library director’s secretary. She’s worked in circulation for a few years, and now she’s a nonarchivist employee who you directly supervise. Maria’s position line was moved to your archive because you needed extra staff. This staff line is classified as a support staff, and will no be able to be reclassified as an archivist position. The staffing change occurred before you became the director.</p>
<p>Maria is deathly afraid of technology. Even typing an email is an issue for Maria. Maria also has a history of making students uncomfortable, due to her diligence to the “rules.” She once made a student cry during a reference interview. Your other staff member Tonya can’t stand Maria. Tonya is responsible for processing and outreach. Maria also terrorizes your student workers. You have a significant electronic records project about to begin during the next semester.</p>
<p>    What do you do with Maria?</p>
<p>    If you chose to fire Maria, how would you reclassify her position to aid with your electronics record program?<br />
    If you decided not to let Maria go, how would you integrate her better into your operations?</p>
<p>    What repercussions could you face if you fire Maria?</p>
