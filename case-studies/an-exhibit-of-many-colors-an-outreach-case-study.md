## Learning Objectives
- Explain the role of exhibits and programs as outreach activities</p>
## Scenario
<p>You're an archivist at a small private university. Your university has ties to a religiously affiliated group, but as of five years ago, it no longer receives funding from that group. One of the board of trustees is appointed by this group, and beyond that, there is no formal connection. The bulk of your archives consists of university records, with some collections in religious scholarship and oral history. As part of your regular programming initiatives, you create small exhibits that highlight portions of your collections.  Alumni weekend is approaching, and you've decided to focus your exhibit on student groups. You've asked for student groups to submit small displays to include with archival material as an outreach initiative that you hope will aid in your collecting. You've told student groups that nothing inappropriate will be allowed into the exhibit, but you haven't defined what that means. One university-sanctioned student group, the recently formed gay-straight alliance, is very eager to include photos and other materials in the exhibit. You also have interest from many older, larger student groups across campus, some of which are informal and not recognized by the university.

### Questions
- How would you design this exhibit in order to clearly tell the story of student life on campus?
- How would you deal with student expectations about how their materials will be exhibited alongside archival materials?
- If there is any backlash to this exhibit, how will you deal with it? What political capital will you need to spend to fairly represent all interested student groups? If a group isn't recognized by the university, does this change how you will approach dealing with any issues that may arise?
