<p>Learning Objectives</p>
<p>    Students will be able to understand issues surrounding the creation of legislation.<br />
    Students will be able to analyze potential ramifications for changes in statutory law to record keeping practices.</p>
<p>Scenario</p>
<p>Recently during the state legislative session, Representative Wayne Herty proposed an update to the states open records law. Because in his words “Other states have a 90 day window for responses to record requests for athletic records. We feel that our state should follow their example.” Rumor has that Herty only came up with this proposal after an extended lunch with the new head coach of the state team Bobby Bryant, but that’s just the rumor. The proposal seemed to go no where during the legislative session, but it seems that during Sine Die it was added to bill concerning water rights for orphaned wood chucks. According to the text of the short amendment of the Wood Chuck, Water Chuck bill, only athletic records would have a longer response period for open records requests. Most records in the state require a response in 3 days, this includes records from the governors office.</p>
