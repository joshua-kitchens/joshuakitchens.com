<p>Welcome</p>
<p>The lecture is dead. Long live the Lecture. I hate the lecture, and as part of my attempts to move away from the lecture model, I've created a series of case studies that can be used to teach archives and archival issues. You'll find them here available&nbsp;under a creative commons license.</p>
